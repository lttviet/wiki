<p>3DS has a built-in feature <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/3ds/built-in-software/streetpass">StreetPass</a> which lets nearby users to exchange data from games and applications.
This is great if you live in a big city where there are a lot of 3DS devices.
However, if you live in a small town, you would be lucky to just get a handful of streetpasses monthly.</p>
<h2 id="streetpass-relay"><a class="header" href="#streetpass-relay">StreetPass Relay</a></h2>
<p>Due to that, Nintendo introduced another feature called <a href="http://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/709/%7E/streetpass-relay-overview">StreetPass Relay</a>.
Every 3DS device has a whitelist of public wifi AP which it can automatically connect to.
If connected, some data will be sent and stored on Nintendo server.
When another 3DS user connects to the same AP, Nintendo server will send the stored data to the latter device.
Consequently, 3DS devices don't have to be in close proximity to exchange data.</p>
<p>The whitelist contains the SSID and MAC of public wifi AP.
Thus, some nice people figured out ways to create homemade StreetPass relays by spoofing MAC and SSID<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.
The basic idea to create a public wifi AP with the same SSID and MAC as in the whitelist.</p>
<p>For Raspberry Pi, there is <a href="http://www.spillmonkey.com/?page_id=169">SpillPass-Pi2</a> which work automatically when you plug in.
You only need a wifi dongle <code>wlan0</code> which support mac spoof and a wired internet connection <code>eth0</code>.</p>
<p>My setup is slightly different because I don't have a wired connection to the home router.
What I have is 2 wifi dongles, <code>wlan0</code> and <code>wlan1</code>.
The idea is still the same, but instead of <code>eth0</code> bridge to <code>wlan0</code>, I have <code>wlan1</code> connected to the internet and <code>wlan0</code> as wifi AP.
All the traffic are forwarded to/from <code>wlan0</code> to <code>wlan1</code>.</p>
<h2 id="setup"><a class="header" href="#setup">Setup</a></h2>
<p>I used <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/">Raspbian Jessie Lite</a> image.
I don't have external keyboard or monitor so desktop on Raspberry Pi is unnecessary.
Installed the image on the SD card by either dd or <a href="https://etcher.io/">Etcher</a>, then added your wifi network to <code>/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</code>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>You can test if AP is working by running <code>sudo hostapd /etct/hostapd/hostapd</code>.
You should be able to see <code>attwifi</code>.</p>
<p>I use <code>dnsmasq</code> to map IP addresses to MAC addresses.
When 3DS connect to my hotspot, it will be assigned a dynamic IP address.

I took the idea of using sqlite3 to store MAC and SSID in a database from danielhoherd's <a href="https://github.com/danielhoherd/homepass/blob/master/RaspberryPi/homepass.sh">script</a>.</p>
<p>The script is rerun every 5 minutes by systemd.

<h2 id="hobby"><a class="header" href="#hobby">Hobby</a></h2>
<p>Gaming is my hobby to pass the time.</p>
<p>Those days I mostly play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gacha_game">mobile gatcha games</a> instead of pc games.
I usually purchase monthly packages so I'm not a f2p player.
I used to balk at the idea of paying monthly subscription to MMOs, but now I do it without blinking for mobile games.</p>
<h2 id="5162021"><a class="header" href="#5162021">5/16/2021</a></h2>
<p>I quitted Arknights because I couldn't get into the story.
It's probably because of the translation as most of the conversations are long-winded and verbose.</p>
<p>I've also cut back on Genshin Impact.
I don't enjoy playing daily quests for 30 minutes then stop.
Nowadays I started the game once every 2 weeks to play story and events.</p>
<p>I no longer care about ranking events in Girls Frontline.
Moreover, with the news of Girls Frontline 2 coming out in the next few years, I think the game will have an ending soon.</p>
<p>I spent $8 in micro transactions this year as my interest dwindled.</p>
<p>Looking back, I have had the feeling (gaming doesn't give me as much dopamine as before) for a long time now but it took a while for me to accept it.
It's interesting that my youtube feed is full of streamers quitting (machine learning/ai at work?).
They were of the similar age to mine so it made sense that we are in the same phase.</p>
<h2 id="682021"><a class="header" href="#682021">6/8/2021</a></h2>
<p>I quit Girls' Frontline as daily login feels like a chore and I no longer enjoy playing the game.
This isn't a spontaneous decision, I have ruminated the idea for a while now.</p>

<p>This is just an auto-battle game with high production quality.
I bought 1 month package so I'm no longer f2p.</p>
<p>Usually I play for 20 minutes in the morning and another 20 minutes before bed.
It's a low commitment game which respect my free times.</p>

<p>This is my first time playing Yakuza serie.
The story is mature which is a great departure from the usual fantasy setup.</p>
<p>I don't particularly enjoy the dungeon sections as I feel they drag out too long.</p>

<p>It was considered by many to be a hard rpg game.
I played on normal mode and found it challenging, but since I'm a fan of megaten series, I'm familiar with the mechanics of exploiting weaknesses, buffs and debuffs.</p>

<p>I started playing Persona 4 back in 2008, but I lost my save so never finished it. 
As the game came to PC, I decided to give it another try.</p>
<p>The gameplay is great, I'd describe it as traditional turn based JRPG combined with dating sim.
IMO the story does overstay its welcome, the beginning feels too long and there are lot of downtimes in the middle.
Moreover I prefer darker theme of Persona 3 to Persona 4.
Persona 4 is still a great game though.</p>
<p>I got the golden ending.
I'm missing a few achievements; I am not a completionist so I don't feel like starting new game + any time soon.</p>
<p>Thanks to the game, I became a longtime fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei">SMT</a> series and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlus">Atlus</a>. I imported <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon%27s_Souls">Demon's Souls</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei:_Strange_Journey">SMT: Strange Journey</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei:_Devil_Survivor">SMT: Devil Survivor</a> to UK when I was in college. Funny enough, I also lost my save to Strange Journey; maybe one day I'll attempt to complete Strange Journey Redux.</p>

<p>I'm a big fan of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/">Slay the Spire</a> and the former game scratches the same itch. 
It combines deck building with tower defense, which are pretty cool.</p>
<p>I got to covenant 25 so I'm taking a break from the game.</p>

<p>The story is ok; I zoned out a lot during the cut screens.
I skipped a bunch of side quests as the game started to become a chore.</p>
<p>The gameplay is pretty fun, rolling around and shooting weak points on machines.
At the beginning stealth was important as my weapons were limited.
By the end of the game, I resolved to use explosives for everything.</p>

<p>It's a pretty comfy game which is divided in 2 parts (farming and dungeoning). 
The controls for farming are clunky and the camera caused me nausea. 
Fighting is quite fun once I got into rhythm.</p>
<p>As usual, I didn't play any end game contents so I can't comment on that.</p>

<p>I finally completed Skyrim after restarting multiple times over the last 5 years. 
I completed the main quests, DLCs and guilds.
There are still some quests left but I'm genuinely happy to put the game down at this point.
It does feel like closing a chapter in my life.</p>
<p>Playing the game in 2021, it feels outdated with floaty combat and multiple crashes and game stopping bugs.
At some point, the game seems like a long to do list.
But I did have a lot of fun role playing a mage, an assassin, dragonborn, a vampire, a werewolf and a thief in one single playthrough.</p>

<p>It took me a couple of restarts before I finally settled on dual swords as my main weapons.
I usually stay on high stance, using Cherry Blossom and Windstorm skills.
Sometimes I switched to mid stance and used God of Wind kick to deplete ki.</p>
<p>The beginning of the game is a bit rough but I got a lot better as I keep playing.
The few final bosses did feel easy; I'm not entirely sure if it was because of good equipments or my skills.</p>
<h3 id="4232021---dlcs"><a class="header" href="#4232021---dlcs">4/23/2021 - DLCs</a></h3>
<p>I completed the DLCs with glaive and magic build.
Similar to dual swords, I mostly stay on high stance and use Empty Retribution and Cyclone.</p>
<p>Currently I'm on Way of Wisdom difficulty.</p>
<h3 id="582021---underworld"><a class="header" href="#582021---underworld">5/8/2021 - Underworld</a></h3>
<p>Done 108 floors and first 5 floors of the depth with 7 Izanagi and 5 Susano.
The build wasn't optimized but it still got me to the depth.
When I tried floor 6, I couldn't do enough damages and the boss can kill me in 2 hits.
Since I was not at max level and my equipments were around +80, I planned to spend some time farming.
Google searches said that from floor 6, the depth tends to drop the same graces that I was wearing so hopefully it wouldn't take long to farm.</p>
<h3 id="5102021---depth"><a class="header" href="#5102021---depth">5/10/2021 - Depth</a></h3>
<p>I switched to 7 Izanagi and 5 Oyamatsumi set to be more tanky.
Moreover, I got a scroll with ultimate magic and realized that I hadn't activated any mystic art with magic.
After doing so, applying buffs took less time and the game felt faster and easier.</p>
<h3 id="5162021---depth-25"><a class="header" href="#5162021---depth-25">5/16/2021 - Depth 25</a></h3>
<p>I got a few better drops and changed my set to 7 Izanagi and 6 Oyamatsumi.
I've done floor 25 of the depth and I'm happy to stop playing at this point.</p>

## [Girls' Frontline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girls%27_Frontline)

Guns as anime girls. 

### 7/31/2020

I finished the Isomer ranking map with 606k scores.
It was good enough to get the exclusive fairy so I had no intention of retrying.

It was a bad day for me mentally; I felt overwhelmed all day.
I cried when I made a bunch of mistakes microing the game.
I ate a whole box of ice cream for dinner.

### 12/21/2020

I procrastinated until the last day to do the Shattered Connexion ranking map.
I got 631k, which was enough to get into top 30% for the beach fairy.

### 5/5/2021

I won't participate in the ranking map for Polarized Light event.

### 6/8/2021

I quit the game.

<p>I really like the movie and its social commentary.
It reminds me of the sayings 'Where you stand depends on where you sit.' and 'Pick your battles.'.
I heard of them a lot around 2008 during the financial crisis.</p>

<p>I binge watched all 3 seasons in 2 days.
The first 2 seasons are great but the last one left me confused.</p>
<p>Every character is flawed and relatable.
They all did the best that they could even if they were bad decisions.
I understand their motives but that certainly doesn't make me like them any more, which isn't a bad thing in itself.</p>
<p>The season 3 finale kinda feels like reverting things back to the original status quo.
But the cat is already out of the bag so it'll never be the same again.
Maybe to move forward, you need to step back and think.
The truth is you can never go back to square 1, time passes, things change.</p>

<p>I found about this through the subreddit; it was originally posted at <a href="https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=288192">bogleheads</a>.
I think interest rate may no longer goes down but TMF still acts as a hedge to UPRO.
Another possibility is that rate may go negative.</p>
<p>I invested most of my fun account into this play at the beginning of 2020.
In March 2020, it was down by 30%. 
Luckily I didn't abandon the strategy and I also kept buying UPRO as it went down.
I also did some re-balancing during that time, sold TMF and bought UPRO.
Since then, it has steadily recovered. 
As of January 2021, it was about 20% up.</p>

<p>I saw the posts about the <a href="https://purple.com/">mattress company</a> on reddit at the end of July 2020.
They had sound arguments and data to back them up.</p>
<p>I made multiple mistakes trading calls.
I sold calls at low strike for more premiums but I wasn't willing to let the shares go.
It cost me half of the profit to buy back the calls.</p>

<p>First time I've ever heard and invested into <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spac.asp">SPAC</a>.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Ackman">Bill Ackman</a> is behind this so it has a lot of hype going.</p>
<p>My paper loss is currently 10%, I'm planning to buy more shares to reduce my average basis.</p>

<p>I watched an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RS4JIEVyXM">interview</a> about the increase in collateral for GME.
On Thursday 1/28/2021, DTCC <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/whats-the-dtcc-and-how-did-it-stop-gamestop-mania/2021/01/29/b23744bc-6257-11eb-a177-7765f29a9524_story.html">raised rate significantly</a>; many brokers including Robinhood halted purchases of shares to protect themselves from liquidity problem.
Robinhood had to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/technology/robinhood-fundraising.html">raise money from investors</a> to resume limited trading on Friday.
Their <a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/29/what-happened-this-week">blog post</a> went into more details about that.</p>
<p>Their PR was bad, making their customers believe that they conspired with Citadel to protect hedge funds.
But I think they'll survive and thrive despite that.</p>

<p>My portfolio allocation is 50% SPY + VTI, 20% VEU, 20% TLT + BND and 10% cash + fun plays.</p>
<p>During March 2020, I sold a bunch of VTI and bought SPY to take advantage of <a href="https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax_loss_harvesting">tax-loss harvesting</a>.
At the time, I didn't know about about SCHB or ITOT and the performance difference between total market index and S&amp;P 500 is small so I decided to buy SPY.
I also considered VOO but I wanted to sell covered call so SPY was more liquid.</p>
<p>Hopefully at some point in the future, I can sell SPY and buy back into VTI to simplify my allocation.</p>
<p>Similarly I was holding VXUS and moved to VEU.
Since VXUS has small cap companies, I also want to move back to it.</p>
<p>As for bonds, I think I was too conservative so I plan to sell TLT and reduce my overall holdings.
Holding only BND is good enough for me; TLT is a little too volatile and it has been going down lately due to rising yield and inflation.</p>
<p>My planned portfolio is 55% VTI, 25% VXUS, 15% BND, 5% cash + fun play.</p>

<p>I'm in a better place mentally and physically.
There have been a lot of ups and downs and it'll be the same going forward.</p>
<p>I'm starting to use Google Sheets as a journal to keep track of my actions and feeling throughout the day.
I've multiple columns (date, action, reason, feeling, reflection).
I'm not sure if spreadsheet is a good medium for journal but I'm giving it a try.</p>
