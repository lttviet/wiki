## I'm reading

- [Reverend Insanity](https://www.webnovel.com/book/7996858406002505/Reverend-Insanity): evil MC, cultivation story.
- [Lord of the Mysteries](https://www.webnovel.com/book/11022733006234505/Lord-of-the-Mysteries): steampunk setting, cool story. The first 100 chapters are tedious, but it keeps getting better after that.
- [Kumo](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/kumo-desu-ga-nani-ka/): Japanese reincarnation light novel. 
- [Tearmoon Empire](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/tearmoon-empire-story/): finished second book. Fun light-hearted story; misunderstanding - the story.
- [Bakarina](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/i-reincarnated-into-an-otome-game-as-a-villainess-with-only-destruction-flags/): reading volume 3. It's not as good as the first 2 books.
