# Trading

This isn't investment, it's pure speculation at best and gambling at worst.

## Why

I feel alive testing my hypotheses, regardless of wins or losses.

## Financial Responsibility

I've a separate retirement account and a fun account.
The former account is invested in boring ETFs and bonds to hold forever.
As for the latter, it isn't a big deal if I lost it all.

I also only allocate a few percentages of my portfolio for every risky play.
So a single loss won't wipe my entire account.
On the flip side, I'm not going to get rich any time soon.

I followed [/r/wallstreetbets](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and it has been a wild ride.
Sometimes I win, sometimes I lose; at least my account is still positive.
I got burnt playing naked options so I don't want to touch them for now.

## Lessons

- Follow [The wheel](https://old.reddit.com/r/options/comments/a36k4j/the_wheel_aka_triple_income_strategy_explained/) strategy loosely. Roll for credit (never debit) or let the shares be called. If opportunity cost is great, let shares be called and use the funds for other plays. Rolling means closing a position and opening a new one; they are independent plays.
- There'll also be ups and downs. As long as I manage my risks properly, I hopefully can live to fight another day.
- It isn't worth it to do this full time; the profit is below minimum wage.

## Plays

**Beware**: [Survivor Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias) belows.

### UPRO/TMF 55/45

I found about this through the subreddit; it was originally posted at [bogleheads](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=288192).
I think interest rate may no longer goes down but TMF still acts as a hedge to UPRO.
Another possibility is that rate may go negative.

I invested most of my fun account into this play at the beginning of 2020.
In March 2020, it was down by 30%. 
Luckily I didn't abandon the strategy and I also kept buying UPRO as it went down.
I also did some re-balancing during that time, sold TMF and bought UPRO.
Since then, it has steadily recovered. 
As of December 2020, it was about 20% up.

### PRPL

I saw the posts about the [mattress company](https://purple.com/) on subreddit at the end of July 2020.
They had sound arguments and data to back them up.

I made multiple mistakes trading calls.
I sold calls at low strike for more premiums but I wasn't willing to let the shares go.
It cost me half of the profit to buy back the calls.

Positions: +100 at $24.72, -1 30C 1/15/2021

Profit: 7.76% (191.9/2472) from selling covered calls.

Plan: PT is about $30.00, wait.

### PSTH

First time I've ever heard and invested into [SPAC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spac.asp).
[Bill Ackman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Ackman) is behind this so it has a lot of hype going.

Position: +63 at $23.25.

Profit: 8.3% (375.33/4520.88) after selling all warranties and reduce position size.

Plan: wait.

### Speculative SPACs

I usually buy near NAV (at most 10% above NAV) and start taking profit after 10% raise.
I don't plan to hold after merger as [historical data](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2020/11/19/a-sober-look-at-spacs/) suggest most companies' stocks fall after ticket change.

#### Pre-target

Positions: +200 SNPR at $10.21, +115 QELL at $10.31, +100 CRHC at $9.95, +100 FUSE at $9.94.

Profit: 1.89% (45.20/2385.6) SNPR, 13.41% (284.53/2121) QELL.

Plan: buy more QELL if it goes down.

#### Target hype

Positions: +100 THCA at $10.63, +100 THBR at 10.72, +100 VSPR at 10.47.

Plan: wait.

### FB

I want to buy and hold FAANG shares.
FB seems like the cheapest out of them.

Position: +10 at $280.61.

Profit: 2.83% (79.72/2812.7) from swing trade to reduce average cost.

Plan: long term hold.

## Done

Profit: 

- 7.17% (146.62/2,043.00) GIX.
- 14.44% (153.05/1060) THCB.
- 20.06% (212.61/1060) APXT.
