# Trading

This isn't investment, it's pure speculation at best and gambling at worst.

## Why

I feel alive testing my hypotheses, regardless of wins or losses.

## Financial Responsibility

I've a separate retirement account and a fun [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/) account.
The former account is invested in boring ETFs and bonds to hold forever.
As for the latter, it isn't a big deal if I lost it all.

I also only allocate 1% or 2% of my portfolio for every risky play.
So a single loss won't wipe my entire account.
On the flip side, I'm not going to get rich any time soon.

I followed [/r/wallstreetbets](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and it has been a wild ride.
Sometimes I win, sometimes I lose; at least my account is still positive.
I got burnt playing naked options so I don't want to touch them for now.

## Plays

**Beware**: [Survivor Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias) belows.

### UPRO/TMF 55/45 Jan 1 2020 - present

About 90% of my account are on this.
I found about this through the subreddit; it was originally posted at [bogleheads](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=288192).

In March 2020, it was down by 30%. 
Luckily I didn't abandon the strategy and I also kept buying UPRO as it went down.
I also did some re-balancing during that time, sold TMF and bought UPRO.

Since then, it has steadily recovered. 
As of today August 2020, it's about 15% up.

### PRPL

I saw the posts about the [mattress company](https://purple.com/) on subreddit at the end of July 2020.
They had sound arguments and data to back them up, at least to my ears anyways.
It was down 11% after earning; I'm at break even point after taking into account the profits from covered calls.

Plan: roll down covered call to 25C 9/18. Let the shares be called if the price recovers.

### PSTHU

First time I've ever heard and invested into [SPAC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spac.asp).
[Bill Ackman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Ackman) is behind this so it has a lot of hype going.

July 2020: bought 234 shares at $21.68.

Plan: pray for good news about the targeted mature unicorn.
