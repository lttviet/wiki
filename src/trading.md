# Trading

This isn't investment, it's pure speculation at best and gambling at worst.

## Why

I feel alive testing my hypotheses, regardless of wins or losses.

## Financial Responsibility

I've a separate retirement account and a fun account.
The former account is invested in boring ETFs and bonds to hold forever.
As for the latter, it isn't a big deal if I lost it all.

I also only allocate a few percentages of my portfolio for every risky play.
So a single loss won't wipe my entire account.
On the flip side, I'm not going to get rich any time soon.

I followed [/r/wallstreetbets](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and it has been a wild ride.
Sometimes I win, sometimes I lose; at least my account is still positive.
I got burnt playing naked options so I don't want to touch them for now.

## Plays

**Beware**: [Survivor Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias) belows.

### UPRO/TMF 55/45

I found about this through the subreddit; it was originally posted at [bogleheads](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=288192).
I invested most of my fun account into this play at the beginning of 2020.

In March 2020, it was down by 30%. 
Luckily I didn't abandon the strategy and I also kept buying UPRO as it went down.
I also did some re-balancing during that time, sold TMF and bought UPRO.

Since then, it has steadily recovered. 
As of September 2020, it was about 15% up.

### PRPL

I saw the posts about the [mattress company](https://purple.com/) on subreddit at the end of July 2020.
They had sound arguments and data to back them up, at least to my ears anyways.
It was down more than 30% after earning but had recovered since. 

- August 2020: bought 100 at $24.72, sold covered calls.

Profit: 10.89% (269.14/2,472) from calls.

Plan: I shorted covered call 25C 10/16 and I plan to let the shares be called.

### PSTH + PSTHWS

First time I've ever heard and invested into [SPAC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spac.asp).
[Bill Ackman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Ackman) is behind this so it has a lot of hype going.

- July 2020: bought 189 at $21.82.
- September 2020: did some swing trades when price was round $22, sold all warranties.

Profit: 3.85% (174.09/4520.88)

Plan: pray for good news about the targeted mature unicorn.

### SNPRU

I've high hope of it as the same management team of SHLL is behind this SPAC.

September 2020: bought 100 at $10.54.

Plan: may buy more

### FB

I want to buy and hold FAANG shares.
FB seems like the cheapest out of them.

September 2020: bought 10 at $281.27.

Plan: long term hold for now.
