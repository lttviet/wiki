# Mind

Compared to myself 9 years ago, I'm at a better position mentally.
There have been a lot of ups and downs and it'll be the same going forward.

I plan to use this page to figure my thinking patterns and hope to better understand my brain.

## Shower

I like taking a long hot shower.
I think too much while showering though; I caught myself a lot of times forgetting whether I've used shampoo or not.

## FI

I was reading into the topic when I came across the health care cost for aging parents.
I need to do a lot of thinking.
A comfy life is expensive, even more so if I ever want kids.
