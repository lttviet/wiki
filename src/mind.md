# Mind

Compared to myself 8 years ago, I'm at a better position mentally.
There have been a lot of ups and downs and it'll be the same going forward.

I plan to use this page to figure my thinking patterns and hope to better understand my brain.

## Shower

I like taking a long hot shower.
I think too much while showering though; I caught myself a lot of times forgetting whether I've used shampoo or not.
