# Mind

I'm in a better place mentally and physically.
There have been a lot of ups and downs and it'll be the same going forward.

I'm starting to use Google Sheets as a journal to keep track of my actions and feeling throughout the day.
I've multiple columns (date, action, reason, feeling, reflection).
I'm not sure if spreadsheet is a good medium for journal but I'm giving it a try.
