# Python

## [Negative number](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators)

Positive numbers have leading 0, negative numbers have leading 1.

```python
# TODO think about this, don't understand why atm
-x = complement(x-1)
```

## Function

A function either returns something or mutate arguments.
Probably put 'mutate' in docstring just in case.
