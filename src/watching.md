# Watching

I'm watching:

1. [Doom Patrol](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8416494/) season 2.
2. [Hololive](https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Hololive). I watched a couple of [Kizuna Ai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kizuna_AI) videos a few years ago then completely forgot about the whole things. On August 2020, I did a quick google to see what is going on with her channel and found out about the new company, VA changes... Youtube started to recommend me some Hololive clips; a few days later I began to watch them live. I like the detective, shark and princess; they're ok in my book. For better youtube viewing, I use [ytcFilter addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ytcfilter/) and [jetri](https://hololive.jetri.co/#/).
3. [HealthyGamerGG](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClHVl2N3jPEbkNJVx-ItQIQ). I started watching the channel after Reckful. I've been trying meditation and improving myself and it's a daily struggle.

## Finished

### [The Platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Platform_(film))

I really like the movie and its social commentary.
It reminds me of the sayings 'Where you stand depends on where you sit.' and 'Pick your battles.'.
I heard of them a lot around 2008 during the financial crisis.

Personally I deliberately and subconsciously choose to be ignorant on many topics.
Maybe one day I'll educate myself on them.

### [Aggretsuko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggretsuko)

I binge watched all 3 seasons in 2 days.
The first 2 seasons are great but the last one left me confused.

Every character is flawed and relatable.
They all did the best that they could even if they were bad decisions.
I understand their motives but that certainly doesn't make me like them any more, which isn't a bad thing in itself.

The season 3 finale kinda feels like reverting things back to the original status quo.
But the cat is already out of the bag so it'll never be the same again.
Maybe to move forward, you need to step back and think.
The truth is you can never go back to square 1, time passes, things change.
