# Watching

I'm watching:

1. [Doom Patrol](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8416494/) season 2.
2. [Hololive](https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Hololive). I watched a couple of [Kizuna Ai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kizuna_AI) videos a few years ago then completely forgot about the whole things. On August 2020, I did a quick google to see what is going on with her channel and found out about the new company, VA changes... Youtube started to recommend me some Hololive clips; a few days later I began to watch them live. I like the detective, reaper and princess; they're ok in my book.
3. [HealthyGamerGG](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClHVl2N3jPEbkNJVx-ItQIQ). I started watching the channel after Reckful. I've been trying meditation and improving myself and it's a daily struggle.

## Finished

### [The Platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Platform_(film))

I really like the movie and its social commentary.
It reminds me of the sayings 'Where you stand depends on where you sit.' and 'Pick your battles.'.
I heard of them a lot around 2008 during the financial crisis.

Personally I deliberately and subconsciously choose to be ignorant on many topics.
Maybe one day I'll educate myself on them.
