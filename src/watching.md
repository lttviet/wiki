# Watching

I'm watching:

1. [Doom Patrol](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8416494/) season 2.
2. [Hololive](https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Hololive). I recently got into vtuber.

## Finished

### [The Platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Platform_(film))

I really like the movie and its social commentary.
It reminds me of the sayings 'Where you stand depends on where you sit.' and 'Pick your battles.'.
I heard of them a lot around 2008 during the financial crisis.

Personally I deliberately and subconsciously choose to be ignorant on many topics.
Maybe one day I'll educate myself on them.
