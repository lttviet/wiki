Guns as anime girls. 

### July 31 2020

I finished the Isomer ranking map with 606k scores.
It was good enough to get the exclusive fairy so I had no intention of retrying.

It was a bad day for me mentally; I felt overwhelmed all day.
I cried when I made a bunch of mistakes microing the game.
I ate a whole box of ice cream for dinner.

### SF capture

It's coming to EN server; I really hope it isn't too much p2w.

## [Arknights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arknights)

Tower defense with anime girls and some males.
