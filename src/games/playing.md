# Playing

## [Genshin Impact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genshin_Impact)

I sometimes open the game whenever a new story or event comes out.

## [Priconne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Connect!_Re:Dive)

This is just an auto-battle game with high production quality.
I bought 1 month package so I'm no longer f2p.

Usually I play for 20 minutes in the morning and another 20 minutes before bed.
It's a low commitment game which respect my free times.

## [Yakuza: Like a Dragon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1235140/Yakuza_Like_a_Dragon/)

This is my first time playing Yakuza serie.
The story is mature which is a great departure from the usual fantasy setup.

I don't particularly enjoy the dungeon sections as I feel they drag out too long.

## [SMT 3 Nocturne](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1413480/Shin_Megami_Tensei_III_Nocturne_HD_Remaster/)

It was considered by many to be a hard rpg game.
I played on normal mode and found it challenging, but since I'm a fan of megaten series, I'm familiar with the mechanics of exploiting weaknesses, buffs and debuffs.
