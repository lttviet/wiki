## [Girls' Frontline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girls%27_Frontline)

Guns as anime girls. 

### July 31 2020

I finished the Isomer ranking map with 606k scores.
It was good enough to get the exclusive fairy so I had no intention of retrying.

It was a bad day for me mentally; I felt overwhelmed all day.
I cried when I made a bunch of mistakes microing the game.
I ate a whole box of ice cream for dinner.

### December 21 2020

I procrastinated until the last day to do the Shattered Connexion ranking map.
I got 631k, which hopefully is enough to get into top 30%.

## [Arknights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arknights)

Tower defense with anime girls and some males.

## [Genshin Impact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genshin_Impact)

My account rank is 51. 
There's not much to do at endgame; I usually spend at most 1 hour everyday for daily quests.
