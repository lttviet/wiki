Guns as anime girls. 

### 7/31/2020

I finished the Isomer ranking map with 606k scores.
It was good enough to get the exclusive fairy so I had no intention of retrying.

It was a bad day for me mentally; I felt overwhelmed all day.
I cried when I made a bunch of mistakes microing the game.
I ate a whole box of ice cream for dinner.

### 12/21/2020

I procrastinated until the last day to do the Shattered Connexion ranking map.
I got 631k, which was enough to get into top 30% for the beach fairy.

### 5/5/2021

I won't participate in the ranking map for Polarized Light event.

## [Genshin Impact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genshin_Impact)

I sometimes open the game whenever a new story or event comes out.

## [Priconne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Connect!_Re:Dive)

This is just an auto-battle game with high production quality.
I bought 1 month package so I'm no longer f2p.

Usually I play for 20 minutes in the morning and another 20 minutes before bed.
It's a low commitment game which respect my free times.
