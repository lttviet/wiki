# Games

Gaming is my hobby to pass the time.

Those days I mostly play [mobile gatcha games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gacha_game) instead of pc games.
I usually purchase monthly packages so I'm not a f2p player.

## I'm playing

- [Girls' Frontline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girls%27_Frontline)
: Guns as anime girls. 
- [Arknights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arknights)
: Tower defense with anime girls (80% of the roster) and some males.
- [Monster Train](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1102190/Monster_Train/): I'm a big fan of [Slay the Spire](https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/) and the former game scratches the same itch. It combines deck building with tower defense, which are pretty cool.
