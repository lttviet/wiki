## Hobby

Gaming is my hobby to pass the time.

Those days I mostly play [mobile gatcha games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gacha_game) instead of pc games.
I usually purchase monthly packages so I'm not a f2p player.
I used to balk at the idea of paying monthly subscription to MMOs, but now I do it without blinking for mobile games.

I quitted Arknights because I couldn't get into the story.
It's probably because of the translation as most of the conversations are long-winded and verbose.

I've also cut back on Genshin Impact.
I don't enjoy playing daily quests for 30 minutes then stop.
Nowadays I started the game once every 2 weeks to play story and events.

I no longer care about ranking events in Girls Frontline.
Moreover, with the news of Girls Frontline 2 coming out in the next few years, I think the game will have an ending soon.

I spent $8 in micro transactions this year as my interest dwindled.

Looking back, I have had the feeling (gaming doesn't give me as much dopamine as before) for a long time now but it took a while for me to accept it.
It's interesting that my youtube feed is full of streamers quitting (machine learning/ai at work?).
They were of the similar age to mine so it made sense that we are in the same phase.

I quit Girls' Frontline as daily login feels like a chore and I no longer enjoy playing the game.
This isn't a spontaneous decision, I have ruminated the idea for a while now.
