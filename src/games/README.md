# Games

Gaming is my hobby to pass the time.

Those days I mostly play [mobile gatcha games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gacha_game) instead of pc games.
I usually purchase monthly packages so I'm not a f2p player.
I used to balk at the idea of paying monthly subscription to MMOs, but now I do it without blinking for mobile games.
