## 7/5/2020 - [Persona 4 Golden](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1113000/Persona_4_Golden/)

I started playing Persona 4 back in 2008, but I lost my save so never finished it. 
As the game came to PC, I decided to give it another try.

The gameplay is great, I'd describe it as traditional turn based JRPG combined with dating sim.
IMO the story does overstay its welcome, the beginning feels too long and there are lot of downtimes in the middle.
Moreover I prefer darker theme of Persona 3 to Persona 4.
Persona 4 is still a great game though.

I got the golden ending.
I'm missing a few achievements; I am not a completionist so I don't feel like starting new game + any time soon.

Thanks to the game, I became a longtime fan of [SMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei) series and [Atlus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlus). I imported [Demon's Souls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon%27s_Souls), [SMT: Strange Journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei:_Strange_Journey) and [SMT: Devil Survivor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei:_Devil_Survivor) to UK when I was in college. Funny enough, I also lost my save to Strange Journey; maybe one day I'll attempt to complete Strange Journey Redux.

## [Monster Train](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1102190/Monster_Train/)

I'm a big fan of [Slay the Spire](https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/) and the former game scratches the same itch. 
It combines deck building with tower defense, which are pretty cool.

I got to covenant 25 so I'm taking a break from the game.

## [Horizon Zero Dawn](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1151640/Horizon_Zero_Dawn_Complete_Edition/)

The story is ok; I zoned out a lot during the cut screens.
I skipped a bunch of side quests as the game started to become a chore.

The gameplay is pretty fun, rolling around and shooting weak points on machines.
At the beginning stealth was important as my weapons were limited.
By the end of the game, I resolved to use explosives for everything.

## [Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1356670/Sakuna_Of_Rice_and_Ruin/)

It's a pretty comfy game which is divided in 2 parts (farming and dungeoning). 
The controls for farming are clunky and the camera caused me nausea. 
Fighting is quite fun once I got into rhythm.

As usual, I didn't play any end game contents so I can't comment on that.
 
## [Skyrim](https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Special_Edition/)

I finally completed Skyrim after restarting multiple times over the last 5 years. 
I completed the main quests, DLCs and guilds.
There are still some quests left but I'm genuinely happy to put the game down at this point.
It does feel like closing a chapter in my life.

Playing the game in 2021, it feels outdated with floaty combat and multiple crashes and game stopping bugs.
At some point, the game seems like a long to do list.
But I did have a lot of fun role playing a mage, an assassin, dragonborn, a vampire, a werewolf and a thief in one single playthrough.

## [Nioh 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1325200/Nioh_2__The_Complete_Edition/)

### 4/12/2021 - Finished main campaign

It took me a couple of restarts before I finally settled on dual swords as my main weapons.
I usually stay on high stance, using Cherry Blossom and Windstorm skills.
Sometimes I switched to mid stance and used God of Wind kick to deplete ki.

The beginning of the game is a bit rough but I got a lot better as I keep playing.
The few final bosses did feel easy; I'm not entirely sure if it was because of good equipments or my skills.

### 4/23/2021 - DLCs

I completed the DLCs with glaive and magic build.
Similar to dual swords, I mostly stay on high stance and use Empty Retribution and Cyclone.

Currently I'm on Way of Wisdom difficulty.

### 5/8/2021 - Underworld

Done 108 floors and first 5 floors of the depth with 7 Izanagi and 5 Susano.
The build wasn't optimized but it still got me to the depth.
When I tried floor 6, I couldn't do enough damages and the boss can kill me in 2 hits.
Since I was not at max level and my equipments were around +80, I planned to spend some time farming.
Google searches said that from floor 6, the depth tends to drop the same graces that I was wearing so hopefully it wouldn't take long to farm.

### 5/10/2021 - Depth

I switched to 7 Izanagi and 5 Oyamatsumi set to be more tanky.
Moreover, I got a scroll with ultimate magic and realized that I hadn't activated any mystic art with magic.
After doing so, applying buffs took less time and the game felt faster and easier.
